# class-exercises
Class warm-up and other exercises introducing and reinforcing concepts

This repo contains folders with JavaScript pages with various exercises from class (usually done by Justin in Arbiter), including comments. The folders are organized by topics. 

It also contains an index.html document linked to all those .js pages. When working on the exercises I open the index page in the Chrome browser, reviewing all console logs in the browser.

PLEASE NOTE: All console.logs are currently commented out, or they would all show up in the console at the same time. To view specific results of a consol.log command, uncomment individually. 

Any comments, suggestions and recommendations are appreciated! :)
