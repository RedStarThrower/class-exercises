Class warm-up and other exercises introducing and reinforcing concepts

This repo contains JavaScript pages with various exercises from class (usually done by Justin in Arbiter), including comments. 
It also contains an index.html document linked to all those .js pages. When working on the exercises I open the index page in the Chrome browser, reviewing all console logs in the browser.
Any comments, suggestions and recommendations are appreciated! :)
